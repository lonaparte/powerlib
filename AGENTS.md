# Repository conventions

Do not run Git commands against this repository.
Source changes and promotions require explicit user authorization.

Write the project name as `powerlib` in prose.
Use `powerlib` for the project's source directory, module root, and namespace.
Use lowercase directory names under `powerlib/` and match their namespace segments.

Promotion copies files and preserves the private workspace. Never promote files
under `archive/`; the promotion script must reject those paths.

Keep build outputs, caches, downloaded dependencies, local tools, and temporary
run results out of Git. Before committing, inspect the staged paths for these
artifacts. Do not force-add ignored build files.

`powerlib/generated/Conversion.lean` and `agda/wire.json` are intentional,
versioned source inputs used to check the Agda-to-Lean interface.
